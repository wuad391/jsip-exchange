(** A logged-in client's outbound event channel.

    One [Session.t] is created per logged-in connection. It holds the
    participant identity established at login plus a pipe that the
    [Dispatcher] writes to whenever a matching-engine event involving this
    participant is produced ([Order_accept], [Order_cancel], [Order_reject],
    [Fill] as aggressor or resting party).

    The reader half is handed back to the client via [session_feed_rpc]; the
    client drains it asynchronously. *)
