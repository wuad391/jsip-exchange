(** Central event-routing component for the gateway.

    Owns subscription registries:

    - **Market-data subscribers**, keyed by [Symbol_id.t]. Each subscriber
      gets a pipe of [Best_bid_offer_update] and [Trade_report] events for
      the symbol they asked about. This is the public market-data feed.

    - **Audit subscribers**, an unfiltered firehose of every event the
      matching engine produces. Intended for the exchange operator's monitor;
      not appropriate to expose to ordinary clients.

    - **Sessions**, table mapping each participant to their session

    [dispatch] is the single place that decides "for each event, who gets
    it". *)

(** Create a dispatcher.

    Events whose audience is a single participant (order-lifecycle responses
    and [Fill] events) are currently handed to a stub [push_to_session] that
    prints them on stdout, prefixed with the target participant. Wiring this
    up to real [Session] outbound pipes is a week-2 exercise. *)
val create : unit -> t

(** Subscribe to public market data for one or more [symbols]. The same pipe
    receives events for every requested symbol; the dispatcher avoids
    duplicates so a subscriber listed against multiple symbols only sees each
    event once. The pipe is removed from the dispatcher when its reader is
    closed. *)

(** Subscribe to the full unfiltered event firehose. Intended for the monitor

val subscribe_audit : t -> Exchange_event.t Pipe.Reader.t

(** Route each event to every interested subscriber:

    - Every event is pushed to every audit subscriber.
    - [Best_bid_offer_update] and [Trade_report] are pushed to the
      market-data subscribers that asked for the event's symbol.
    - [Order_accept], [Order_cancel], and [Order_reject] are pushed to the
      session of the order's owning participant (if logged in).
    - [Fill] is pushed to both the aggressor's and the resting party's
      session (if either is logged in).

    Each session lookup is O(1) and independent of subscriber count. *)
