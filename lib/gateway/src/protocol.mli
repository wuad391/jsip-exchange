(** Text protocol for communicating with the exchange.

    This module defines how order requests are represented as text and how
    exchange events are formatted for display. On a production exchange, this
    would be a binary protocol like FIX for performance and interoperability.
    We use a simple human-readable text format for ease of debugging and
    interactive use.

    {2 Command format}

    Each command is a single line of text:
    {v
    BUY  <symbol> <size> <price> [<time_in_force>] [as <participant>]
    SELL <symbol> <size> <price> [<time_in_force>] [as <participant>]
    v}

    Examples:
    {v
    BUY AAPL 100 150.25
    SELL TSLA 50 200.00 IOC
    BUY AAPL 100 150.00 DAY as Alice
    v}

    Time-in-force defaults to DAY if omitted. Participant defaults to
    "anonymous" if omitted. *)

(** Format an exchange event as a single line of human-readable text. When a
    [directory] is supplied (the client fetches it at connect via
    {!Rpc_protocol.symbol_directory_rpc}), symbol ids render as their human
    names; otherwise they render as the numeric id. *)

(** Format a list of events, one per line. See {!format_event} for
    [directory]. *)
