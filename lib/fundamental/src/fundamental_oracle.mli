(** A simulated "true price" process per symbol.

    The matching engine has no concept of fundamental value: prices are
    wherever orders cross. To produce visually-interesting traffic, the bot
    ecosystem needs an exogenous notion of fair value to anchor strategies.
    This oracle simulates one.

    Each symbol's price evolves as a discretized Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process:
    a random walk with optional mean reversion toward [initial_price]. The
    Gaussian noise is drawn from a [Splittable_random.t] seeded at
    construction so a given seed + scenario produces deterministic price
    trajectories.

    Bots read the current price directly via [price]. This is unrealistic
    relative to real markets (where there is no oracle) but is the right
    tradeoff for a teaching prototype: it makes scenarios easy to script and
    bot behavior easy to reason about. *)
