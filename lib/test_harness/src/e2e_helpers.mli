    buffered session feed so [rpc_submit] can return the events produced by
    the just-submitted request. *)

    (audit log subscriptions, second clients on the same connection, etc.). *)

(** Submit an order via RPC. The RPC is one-way: this returns once the server
    has enqueued the request. Participant-targeted events (acceptance, fills,
    rejection) are currently printed on the server's stdout via the
    dispatcher's session stub. *)
