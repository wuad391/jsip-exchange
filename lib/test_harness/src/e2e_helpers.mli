    [0, 1, ..., num_symbols - 1]), run [f], then shut down. [limits]
    overrides the per-participant rate limits (default
    {!Jsip_gateway.Session.Limits.default}); rate-limit tests pass tight
    limits to trip the limiter deterministically. *)

(** A test client: an open RPC connection to the server. A future revision
    (once the session-feed RPC and login flow exist) will extend this with a
    buffered session feed so [rpc_submit] can return the events produced by
    the just-submitted request. *)

    per-participant events when an expect test binds. *)

(** The raw RPC connection, useful for tests that exercise unusual RPC paths
    (audit log subscriptions, second clients on the same connection, etc.). *)

(** Submit an order via RPC. The RPC is one-way: this returns once the server
    has enqueued the request. Participant-targeted events (acceptance, fills,
    rejection) are currently printed on the server's stdout via the
    dispatcher's session stub. *)
