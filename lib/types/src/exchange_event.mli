(** Events produced by the matching engine.

    In a production exchange, events would be messages on a replicated
    stream, with all components seeing the same ordered sequence to keep
    their state consistent. The message schema would have dozens of variants
    for different order types, market data, control messages, etc.

    We model events as a simple variant type. The matching engine produces
    events; the gateway and market data systems consume them. *)
