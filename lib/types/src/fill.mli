(** A fill (execution) produced by the matching engine when two orders trade.

    Every fill involves exactly two sides: the "aggressor" (the incoming
    order that caused the match) and the "resting" order (which was already
    on the book). Both sides see the fill, but from their own perspective.

    A production exchange fill would carry additional metadata: liquidity
    flags, regulatory indicators, fee codes, timestamps, etc. *)
