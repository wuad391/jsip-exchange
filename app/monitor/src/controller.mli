(** The monitor's pure state machine.

    A [Controller.t] holds everything the UI needs to render a single frame:
    the running event log, which filters are enabled, what the user is
    currently typing into the substring box, and whether the app should quit.
    [handle_key] and [feed_event] are pure transitions — the bonsai_term
    layer threads them through [Bonsai.state] and renders [display] to the
    screen.

    The state machine is intentionally testable without bringing in any
    bonsai_term machinery: the only bonsai_term type it touches is
    [Event.Key.t], which is a plain variant. *)
