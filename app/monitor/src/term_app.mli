(** Bonsai_term rendering for the monitor.

    Wraps the pure [Controller] state machine into a bonsai_term component.
    The controller's state lives in a [Bonsai.state_machine] managed inside
    [app]; on graph activation [app] starts draining the supplied [events]
    pipe directly into that state machine. *)

(** The bonsai_term app. Pass to [Bonsai_term.start_with_exit]. [events] is
    the pipe of exchange events the app should drain into its controller
    (typically the reader returned by [Rpc_protocol.audit_log_rpc]).
    [directory] is the id<->name map (fetched at connect via
    {!Rpc_protocol.symbol_directory_rpc}) the controller renders symbols
    with; pass {!Jsip_gateway.Symbol_directory.empty} to show raw ids. The
    drain starts when the Bonsai graph activates and ends when [events] is
    closed. *)
