(** A filterable, color-tagged log of exchange events for the monitor UI.

    A pure model — no Async, no Bonsai, no terminal primitives. The monitor's
    UI layer (built on bonsai_term) drives this model by feeding it events
    and setting filters, then renders [visible_styled_lines] to the screen.

    The model holds events in insertion order. [add_event] appends; queries
    return the active subset under the current [Filter.t]. *)

    only orders" / "show only trades" / "show only market data" filters.
    [of_event] is the only classification helper — finer granularity is
    expressed by pattern-matching on the [Exchange_event.t] itself. *)
