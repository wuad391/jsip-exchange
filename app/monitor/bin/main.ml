(** [jsip-monitor]: a bonsai_term TUI that subscribes to the exchange's audit
    log and renders a filterable, color-coded stream of every event the
    matching engine produces.

    Connects to an exchange server at the given host/port, subscribes via
    [Rpc_protocol.audit_log_rpc], and hands the resulting pipe to
    [Term_app.app], which drains it directly into its Bonsai state machine. *)
