(** A noise trader: a stand-in for the mass of real-world, non-informed
    trading activity (index rebalancing, retail flow, a corporation
    liquidating an acquisition). It has no view on price direction -- each
    tick it randomly picks a symbol, side, size, price, and time-in-force and
    fires a single order. Together with a
    {!Jsip_market_maker.Market_maker_bot} it gives the matching engine a
    steady stream of activity for the other bots to observe and react to.

    Implements {!Jsip_bot_runtime.Bot_runtime.Bot}. See
    [doc/exercises-part-2.md] Exercise 4. Wire one into a scenario with
    {!Jsip_scenario_runner.Bot_spec}. *)

      so a fast clock can still trade sparsely.
    - [aggressiveness_pct]: percent (0-100) an order is marketable rather
      than resting.
    - [ioc_pct]: percent (0-100) an order is [Ioc] rather than [Day]. *)
