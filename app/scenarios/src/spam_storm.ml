(* A fleet of specialized spammers. Instead of one generic flood, each bot
   below is tuned to hammer ONE shared resource as hard as it can, so that
   run together they load every path through the exchange at once. The knobs
   are not independent attacks -- [marketable_chance] picks *which*
   downstream work an order generates, and [time_in_force_distribution] picks
   whether it *rests* (memory) or *churns* (CPU). The four archetypes, and
   the resource each targets:

   - [fan-out-storm]: 100% marketable, Ioc -- subscriber pipes / dispatcher
   - [deep-sweep]: 100% marketable, Ioc -- matching-engine CPU per order
   - [book-bloat]: 0% marketable, Day -- order-book memory + scan cost
   - [queue-flood]: 0% marketable, Ioc -- bounded request-queue intake

   The spammers are also symbiotic: [book-bloat] rests thousands of orders
   across a wide price band, which is exactly the deep resting liquidity the
   two marketable spammers then sweep through. Because each spammer is a
   distinct participant (and the matching engine now prevents self-trades),
   their marketable orders cross each other's -- and the market maker's and
   noise trader's -- resting liquidity, so a single spammer never just fills
   itself. *)

(* Attacks the subscriber pipes and dispatcher fan-out (the unbounded
   [Pipe.write_without_pushback_if_open] path). Every order is marketable, so
   each one amplifies into Fill + Trade_report events plus a moving BBO --
   the most events-per-order the exchange can emit. [mean_size] is tiny so an
   order crosses ~one level and the burst is a stream of *many cheap crosses*
   (max event count, not deep sweeps); [Ioc] means nothing rests, so every
   tick is a fresh wave and the leftover cancels (one more event). Small
   [price_jitter] keeps orders near the touch so they reliably cross. *)

;;

(* Attacks matching-engine CPU. Same marketable/[Ioc] shape as fan-out-storm,
   but [mean_size] is large and [price_jitter] crosses *deep* past the touch,
   so each order walks many resting levels in a single [match_loop] recursion
   -- long sweeps and many book removals per order. Fewer orders per burst
   because each one is individually expensive to match. *)

;;

(* Attacks order-book memory and per-match scan cost. Nothing is marketable,
   so every order rests; [Day] means it rests until end-of-day and never
   leaves. A wide [price_jitter] spreads the burst across ~400 distinct price
   levels, fattening the price->orders maps so every future [find_match] /
   [best_level] scans more. Balanced [buy_chance] bloats both sides. Large
   burst because the whole point is unbounded accumulation. *)

  }
;;

(* Attacks the bounded request queue itself -- raw intake rate. Everything is
   unmarketable *and* [Ioc], so each order does the least possible downstream
   work: it crosses nothing (no fills, no fan-out) and rests nothing (no
   memory), just Order_accept + Order_cancel and out. That isolates the
   attack onto submission throughput. Huge [orders_per_burst] paired with the
   tightest [tick_interval] below pins the queue faster than the single
   matching loop can drain it. *)
