(* A single-symbol market with four participants, arranged to show a
   pump-and-dump extracting money from a price-chaser:

   - the [pump-and-dumper] ({!Spammer} in its [Pump_and_dump] behavior) walks
     AAPL up on marketable buys, then dumps its inventory once the mid has
     risen;
   - the [momentum-trader] reads the public tape and chases the rising price
     -- it is the intended victim, buying near the top and left holding as
     the price falls back;
   - the [market-maker] quotes a ladder anchored on the *fundamental*, so it
     is NOT fooled into repricing upward: it supplies the offers the pump
     lifts on the way up and mostly refuses to chase. This is the control --
     against it alone the scheme is barely profitable;
   - the [noise-trader] supplies organic two-sided flow, so the book has real
     resting bids for the dump to land in and the manipulation hides in
     noise.

   The contrast between the momentum trader (chases, gets hurt) and the
   market maker (value-anchored, mostly doesn't) is the whole point: the
   scheme only extracts money from participants who trade on price rather
   than value. *)

(* The manipulator. Every knob is chosen relative to the other bots below:
   [clip_size] is 3x the market maker's [size_per_level] so each buy walks
   several offer levels; [pump_target_pct] of 1% (a 150-cent move off 150.00)
   is well above the momentum trader's 10-cent trigger, so the pump trips the
   victim long before the target is hit; [max_inventory] of 150 is a long the
   momentum trader (max_position 250) plus the noise-trader bids can
   plausibly absorb on the dump; [give_up_ticks] of 40 (~10s at this tick
   rate) gives the pump time to work but guarantees an unwind if it stalls. *)
