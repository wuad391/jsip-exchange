(* A staircase of shocks: a run of positive steps builds a sustained uptrend,
   then a run of negative steps reverses it into a downtrend. Each step is
   larger than the momentum trader's [threshold_cents] and they arrive a few
   seconds apart, so the trader's price window fills with a clear one-way
   move and its signal crosses the threshold in each direction in turn -- it
   should buy into the rise and sell into the fall. Priced in a single place
   so the trend's shape is easy to retune. *)

(* The star of the scenario. A short window and a modest threshold make it
   react within a couple of steps of a trend; [cooldown_ticks] keeps one
   sustained move from firing on literally every tick. [Ioc] entries take
   whatever the market maker and noise trader are resting near the touch and
   cancel the rest, so the trader's position tracks the trend without leaving
   stale orders behind. *)
