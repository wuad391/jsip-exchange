   its resting asks sit below the new fair value and get swept -- that's the
   maker "getting run over". *)

   through the shock instead of standing aside, and a one-second tick means
   its ladder lags the instantaneous jump in fair value -- exactly the

   react within a couple of ticks once the post-jump trades start printing
   higher; its [Ioc] entries chase the move up, taking the maker's now-cheap
