   only prints the internal books when [print_books] is set). Per-symbol
   state lives in a table keyed by symbol; inventory skew, the shared

   across all symbols. *)

         where we'd quote, instead of re-seeding on every tick of the market

     fill and a [Best_bid_offer_update] can each trigger a reseed, and both
     involve real RPC round-trips (real [Async] yields), so without this
     guard two reseeds for the same symbol can overlap: the second one's
     [cancel_all_orders] reads [bids]/[asks] before the first one's
     [seed_book] has finished repopulating them, orphaning orders that never
     get cancelled and never get tracked. Left resting, those orphans quote
     at a stale (and, after enough churn, wildly skewed) price and sit
     alongside the fresh ladder, so the book alternates between two unrelated
     price levels. Skipping a reseed while one is already in flight is safe:
     the in-flight one will pick up the current inventory and BBO when it
     re-derives its target from scratch, and further events keep arriving to
     trigger a fresh check afterward. *)
