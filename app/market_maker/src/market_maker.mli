(** A simple market-making bot.

    A market maker provides liquidity by continuously quoting both a bid
    (buy) and an ask (sell) price. They profit from the spread between the
    two prices, but take risk if the market moves against their inventory.

    This bot places a fixed set of resting orders on both sides of the book
    around a configured "fair value" price. *)
