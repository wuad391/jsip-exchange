# CI base image for the JSIP exchange project.
#
# This image bakes in the OxCaml compiler (ocaml-variants.5.2.0+ox) and every
# opam dependency of the project, so CI never has to build the compiler or
# recompile dependencies on each run. It is built and pushed to GitHub
# Container Registry by .github/workflows/build-image.yml, and consumed by
# .github/workflows/ci.yml via the `container:` key.
#
# Rebuild the image (via that workflow) whenever the dependency set changes.

FROM ubuntu:24.04

# opam settings that make sense inside a container:
#  - OPAMROOT: keep the opam root at a predictable, root-owned location.
#  - OPAMROOTISOK / OPAMYES / OPAMCONFIRMLEVEL: this image is built as root and
#    non-interactively, so allow that without prompting.
#  - OPAMSWITCH: the switch we create below; makes `opam env` unambiguous.
